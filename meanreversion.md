# Mean Reversion Trading Strategy

## Overview

The Mean Reversion Trading Strategy is designed to exploit the tendency of an asset's price to revert to its mean. This strategy identifies trading opportunities based on deviations from the average price, aiming to profit from the price oscillations around the mean.

## Strategy Details

### Indicators Used

- **Moving Average (MA)**: Calculates the average closing price over a specified period (e.g., 20 days).
- **Standard Deviation (SD)**: Measures the volatility of the price over the same period.

### Entry Criteria

- **Buy Signal**: Triggered when the asset's price falls below the moving average by more than two standard deviations. This suggests the asset may be oversold and could be a good buying opportunity.

### Exit Criteria

- **Sell Signal**: Triggered when the asset's price rises above the moving average by more than two standard deviations. This suggests the asset may be overbought and could be a good selling opportunity.

### Parameters

- **Moving Average Period**: 20 days
- **Standard Deviation Multiplier**: 2

## Example Code

The strategy implementation can be found in the provided code file. It includes:

- **Fetching Historical Data**: Uses `yfinance` to download historical price data for the asset.
- **Strategy Implementation**: Defines the mean reversion strategy using the Moving Average and Standard Deviation.
- **Backtesting and Results**: Runs the strategy using the Backtesting library and prints out the results including annual return and volatility.

## Results

The backtest will output the following metrics:

- **Annual Return**: The percentage return generated by the strategy on an annual basis.
- **Annual Volatility**: The standard deviation of returns on an annual basis.
- **Asset Price**: The historical price of the asset.
- **Moving Average**: The moving average line over the specified period.
- **Standard Deviation Range**: Shaded area representing two standard deviations above and below the moving average.

## Strategy Code
from backtesting import Backtest, Strategy
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

class MeanReversionStrategy(Strategy):
    moving_avg_period = 20
    stddev_multiplier = 2
    
    def init(self):
        # Calculate moving average and standard deviation
        self.moving_avg = self.data.Close.rolling(window=self.moving_avg_period).mean()
        self.stddev = self.data.Close.rolling(window=self.moving_avg_period).std()

    def next(self):
        # Buy signal: Price below moving average - 2 * standard deviation
        if self.data.Close[-1] < self.moving_avg[-1] - self.stddev_multiplier * self.stddev[-1]:
            if not self.position:
                self.buy()
        
        # Sell signal: Price above moving average + 2 * standard deviation
        elif self.data.Close[-1] > self.moving_avg[-1] + self.stddev_multiplier * self.stddev[-1]:
            if self.position:
                self.sell


## Notes

- Ensure that the required libraries (`backtesting`, `yfinance`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`) are installed.
- The symbol `US30` is used as a proxy for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Adjust the symbol or data source as needed for your specific use case.
